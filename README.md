## working in local

_**TRICK**_
having 2 file in 2 branch in same time with easy navigation
and easy changing each!

- for this you can duplicate your git project with all
  git informations, one of this replicas is for navigation
  between different git nodes and watching them and another
  is for work that you currently on.

## working with remote
